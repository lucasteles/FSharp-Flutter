# F# + Flutter

- Simple Todo app based on https://www.section.io/engineering-education/how-to-build-a-flutter-todo-app/

- run `./build.sh` (or just copy & paste the commands in the script to a terminal) to start Fable in watch mode. Use the IDE to start debugging the Flutter app, you'll have to trigger hot reload manually after changes in F# code (e.g. in VS Code with Flutter extension press Ctr+F5).
